  My name is Alondra Jauregui-Jauregui though everyone calls me Alo for short. I am a junior in highschool at Aspire Golden State Prep. I was born and raised in Oakland CA.

    My coding experiences:
    I enjoy coding a ton and i think its a eally fun way to meet new people and have more experiences. 
    I was in a coding afterschool program in the 8th grade,and the name was Capital One CODERS. 
    We learned how to code games and I was even able to make my own app!
    I later went into the 10th grade and was given a free coding class which was named Scripted at the time but now it is Code Nation!

  Some little things about myself are that I enjoy being in the outdoors. I love nature a lot! I also love turtles, I think they are the best most adorable reptiles I have ever owned. I own 5 amazing chickens, and 1 wonderful rooster.
